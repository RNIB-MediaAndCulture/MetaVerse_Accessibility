# MetaVerse_Accessibility
This document aims to encompass the ways in which the metaverse is or may be used in order to identify accessibility barriers and offer suggested solutions. It is broadly inspired by object based programming where something can 'inherit' properties from parents. In this way it offers 'aspects of experience' which will embody aspects of a metaverse use case. A guided tour of a museum will inherit from Exhibition and Presentation whereas a guided tour of the White House will inherit from Virtual Space and Presentation and a virtual representation of Pompei may inherit from Exhibition and Virtual Space. The document then lists relevant mechanics for each aspect of experience. These are actions you might expect to perform as part of this experience or ways in which you might expect to interact with it. These describe potential accessibility barriers and ways in which you might overcome those barriers. The suggestions of ways to overcome the barriers may point to accessibility design patterns.
